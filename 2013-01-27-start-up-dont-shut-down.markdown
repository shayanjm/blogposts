A number of people have asked me: "How do you fit everything in a day, and still have time to sleep?"

To that, I sort of laugh awkwardly and mumble something about "what's sleep?" - because quite frankly, it's really hard to explain.<!-- more --> Anyone who knows me well, will tell you straight off the bat: time management is not, and has never been, my strong suit. For instance, I'd much rather do something I really enjoy than do productive work *(everyone suffers from this, but I am especially bad at prioritizing...)*. But I think that's where a distinction needs to be drawn.

*"Work"* is really a word with a relative definition. The way you might define *"work"* might not be the way I define it. Homework is *work*. Labs are *work*. Getting up for lectures is *work*. 

But I don't define my "outside of school activities" as *work*. Collaborating with likeminded people to solve a problem *is not work*. Building solutions *is not work*. The hard part, though, is to really figure out where your priorities are.

One of my professors dropped this gem in a conversation I had with him about balancing entrepreneurial stuff and a rigorous degree plan, and I think it's a really profound statement:

> "Real money creates real emergencies."

At first glance, it's obvious - but delve into it deeper and you'll start seeing some implications. The moment money is involved in anything, priorities get rearranged. Whether its a job offer, a lucrative opportunity, or a vision you'd like to see through to the end; money always gets prioritized over all else. While I know I need a degree, the allure of the startup world is always there for me. I love the idea of being able to see my ideas grow into tangible things that make people's lives better. The name of the game here is to start up, without shutting down all other goals - so, I organized a few "tennants" to help me with the prioritization process and provide some guidelines.

Build a solution, not a company.
================================
The moment the "omg I started a company!" mentality kicks in, the vision tends to get diluted. Goals shift towards profitability rather than solving a problem - and again:

> "Real money creates real emergencies."

Build solutions to aches and pains in the world. It could even be an open sourced side project - just do cool things. Monetizing should be the last step to the vision, as building a robust solution should take up the majority of your time. This will allow you to budget your time more effectively (especially in the face of education), as you treat it more as a project than a venture.

Solve problems you face, and scale to become general.
=====================================================
The most potent problems are the ones you face daily. A popular purveyor of this mentality is 37Signals (creators of Ruby on Rails). 

> A great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems. You'll be the target audience and you'll know what's important and what's not... The key here is understanding that you're not alone. If you're having this problem, it's likely hundreds of thousands of others are in the same boat.

Build a solution to aches and pains that **you** face, and scale that solution to encompass more generality.

Stay realistic.
===============
Pave your own path. Don't compare yourself to Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, because statistics are against you. Humility is your greatest asset, as it will keep you grounded in your words and in your mind. Delusions of grandeur are dangerous, and can lead you down the path of chasing money. You have a great idea? Excellent! Now prove it through execution. Builders are the greats of our era. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg didn't get where they are now by talking about their ideas. They built them - and for the most part stayed within the bounds of the tennants above.
