Earlier on in March, I was trying to source a freelance front-end developer to help bridge the gap between what we had designed and actual implementation. We were running out of time so I needed someone quickly - so I looked to find someone on [Gun.IO](http://www.gun.io/). I very quickly got a number of replies back and at the end found someone we felt comfortable in going forward with -- however something odd happened in the interim.
