I sat here thinking for a while, "How should I even go about phrasing this post?". I mean, it's a bold claim - but it's one we all know is true in some way or another. High School Education *is* broken. As entrepreneurs, when something is broken - we have to fix it.
<!-- more -->
Coming from a super-competitive *(read: asian)* school district, I've practically grown up with competition. Our entire purpose from the 9th grade was to maintain a good GPA, and come close to maxing our test scores. Needless to say, I was very disenchanted by the whole process. 
*We were learning information for the sole purpose of regurgitating back for the next test.*

As far as I was concerned, there really weren't any real-world applications for what we were learning. I could understand that "what we learn in high school is a platform for learning things we will use in the industry", but surely after 12 years of schooling - we must have **SOMETHING** that could be useful to us outside of school?

Yeah, High School is Broken, but Education isn't
------------------------------------------------
Thankfully I was really involved in science fair throughout 9th-12th grades (Intel ISEF, MILSET ESI, AJAS, I left no stone unturned) - so I got to see the other side of the coin. The moment I stepped into the display hall of any given competition, it was apparent to me that innovation in high schoolers was far from dead. On the contrary, a lot of the things being built and hacked upon at these competitions were very marketable.

So where did they learn these skills?

Well, these students are part of a number of subgroups.

**Exhibit A: The Super-Motivated:**

*These kids, tend to seek out research opportunities to augment their already packed resume. Entering their project into a competition amongst their peers was an afterthought. These guys eat DiffEQ for breakfast. Live to learn.*

**Exhibit B: My Dad Is A Professor:**

*They would much rather not be doing research, but their parents want to see a 4.0 and a PhD down the line. Pushed to learn.*

**Exhibit C: The Hacker:**

*Not a fan of sitting around and getting lectured at about subjects they'll never touch again. Always asking "why?", and seeking to build amazing things. Self initiated learner, and primarily self-taught.*

In some way or another, for whatever motivation or reason - these particular students fell into a cycle of innovation much earlier than their peers. Whether it was due to an outside force, or an internal struggle, all three subgroups consistently show that innovation in high schools/high school aged kids is not only possible - but viable.

So where's the innovation in High School curriculum? We need marketable skills to capture students' interest, and build a generation of inquisitive minds who are ready to take on the world's innumerable challenges.
